# Retinal Image Analysis for Early Detection and Prediction of Eye Diseases

This project focuses on the early detection and prediction of eye diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), and Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) using retinal fundus images. The goal is to create a reliable and robust multi-disease detection system by integrating models for early detection of these diseases, improving diagnosis, and enabling timely interventions.

## Abbreviations
- **DR**: Diabetic Retinopathy
- **GL**: Glaucoma
- **AMD**: Age-Related Macular Degeneration
- **RVO**: Retinal Vein Occlusion

## Recent Updates
- **Dec 2024**: Successfully integrated new model architecture for DR, Glaucoma, AMD, and RVO detection.

## Main Components
- **DR Detection**: A model trained to identify Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal images.
- **AMD Detection**: A model designed to detect Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).
- **Glaucoma Detection**: A model for detecting Glaucoma using retinal images.
- **RVO Detection**: A model for identifying Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO).
